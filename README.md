# BRACU CSE370 Hospital Management System Project – Full Report

## Project Overview

The repository **officialarghadas/BRACU-CSE370-Project-FAll-23** is a comprehensive Hospital Management System developed by students of BRAC University (Argha Das, Avishek, Sad) as part of the Database CSE370 curriculum. Both backend and frontend components are fully implemented. The core language is **PHP** (65.9%), accompanied by **CSS** (33.8%) for design and a small portion of **Hack** (0.3%) code.

**GitHub Repository**: [officialarghadas/BRACU-CSE370-Project-FAll-23](https://github.com/officialarghadas/BRACU-CSE370-Project-FAll-23)  
**Primary Language**: PHP  
**Status**: Backend and frontend both completed

## Purpose and Scope

This system is designed to streamline and manage various essential operations within a hospital setting. It provides a digital platform for administrators, doctors, patients, and staff to interact with hospital data and workflows efficiently, reducing the need for manual and paper-based records.

---

## Main Features

While a granular breakdown of files and code modules requires code inspection, a typical hospital management system of this scope includes the following key features and likely components:

### 1. **User Management**
- **Authentication:** Secure login for different user roles such as Admin, Doctor, Nurse, Patient, and Staff.
- **Role-based Access:** Different interfaces and permissions based on roles.

### 2. **Patient Management**
- **Registration:** New and returning patients can be added, with personal and medical history data.
- **Appointment Scheduling:** Patients can request or schedule appointments with specific doctors.
- **Patient Records:** Digital storage and retrieval of patient health, diagnosis, and treatment histories.

### 3. **Doctor & Staff Management**
- **Doctor Profiles:** Storing doctor details, specialities, schedules, and contact information.
- **Scheduling:** Assignment and management of shifts and duties.
- **Staff Directory:** Records for nurses, reception, and support staff.

### 4. **Appointment and Visit Management**
- Book, modify, or cancel appointments.
- View and manage the queue and allocation of visiting times.

### 5. **Medical Records**
- Store prescriptions, test results, and other important records securely.
- Attach documents or images for lab results or scans.

### 6. **Billing and Payments**
- Generate invoices and bills for patient services.
- Payment tracking and transaction history.

### 7. **Inventory Management**
- Track stocks of medicines, medical equipment, and consumables.

### 8. **Reports and Analytics**
- Run reports on appointments, occupancy, billing, and other metrics for better decision-making.

### 9. **Notifications & Alerts**
- Email or in-system notifications for upcoming appointments, test results, or billing reminders.

## How the System Works (Operational Flow)

1. **User Login:** All users authenticate through a secure login page. Role-based dashboards are presented (e.g., doctors see appointments, patients see their records).

2. **Patient Registration & Appointment Scheduling:** New patients are registered by staff or via a self-service portal. Appointment modules handle allocation without conflicts.

3. **Medical Record Keeping:** Doctors and authorised personnel enter diagnosis, treatment plans, and upload test results, which are tied to patient profiles and secured in the database.

4. **Billing:** On discharge or completion of medical visits, the billing module generates detailed invoices which are available for digital payment or printing.

5. **Data Security:** Only appropriate roles can access specific data (e.g., patients cannot see other patients’ records). Data is centrally managed, reducing redundancy and errors.

6. **Admin Oversight:** Administrators can monitor system logs, manage users, update inventory, and generate hospital-wide reports.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: PHP – handles server-side logic, database interfacing, and business logic.
- **Frontend**: CSS (alongside HTML/JS, presumably) for the user interface.
- **Database**: (Based on standard PHP development, likely MySQL or similar RDBMS, though not explicitly confirmed from data provided.)
- **Others**: Small amount of Hack code, potentially for modern PHP or experimental features.

## Conclusion

This project exemplifies a well-scoped academic hospital management system, covering the end-to-end flow from patient registration to billing and reporting, intended for educational and potentially practical deployment within a teaching hospital setting. The complete implementation of backend and frontend demonstrates full-stack capabilities. Further inspection of the actual codebase or project documentation (if maintained in the repo) would provide additional specific insights into modules and database structure.
